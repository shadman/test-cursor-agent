# test-git-copilot

A small placeholder repository for experimenting with a cursor agent implementation and related tests.

This repository is currently empty. This README provides project intent, developer guidance, and contribution instructions to help onboard collaborators and organize future work.

## Status
- Repository initialized but currently has no commits. This README is the suggested initial project scaffold.

## Project overview
A cursor agent is responsible for navigating and interacting with paginated or stream-like data sources using cursors (tokens, offsets, timestamps, etc.). This project gathers experiments, prototypes, and tests for building reliable cursor-based agents that can:
- Continuously consume data from paginated APIs
- Resume consumption reliably after interruptions using saved cursors
- Coordinate cursor advancement across distributed workers
- Provide reproducible tests and benchmarks

## What you'll find here (planned)
- Example implementations (language-specific directories)
- Unit and integration tests validating resume/retry behavior
- Benchmarks and profiling scripts
- Design notes and architecture diagrams

## Getting started (local)
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/shadman/test-cursor-agent.git

2. Create a working branch and add your code:
   git checkout -b feat/implement-cursor
   # add files, run tests, commit
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add initial cursor agent prototype"
   git push -u origin feat/implement-cursor

3. Open a pull request against main when ready.

If this repository is empty (no default branch), create the initial commit locally:
   git init
   echo "# test-cursor-agent" > README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "chore: add README (project scaffold)"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/shadman/test-cursor-agent.git
   git push -u origin main

## Development
- Use a reproducible dev environment (e.g., devcontainer, Dockerfile, or nvm/pyenv setup).
- Keep examples and tests small and focused.
- Document assumptions and failure modes in design notes.

## Testing & CI
- Add unit tests for cursor persistence and resume logic.
- Add integration tests that simulate API pagination and failures.
- Consider a simple CI workflow that runs tests and lints on push/PR.

## Contributing
- Open issues for bugs or feature requests with a clear description and reproduction steps.
- Submit pull requests with tests and a short description of the change.
- Follow conventional commits for easier changelog generation.

## License
- No license specified yet. Add a LICENSE file (MIT, Apache-2.0, etc.) to set one.
